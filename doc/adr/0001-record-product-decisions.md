# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2018-07-05

## Status

Accepted

## Abstract

We will store decisions in ADRs on GitHub.

## Context

We need to record the product decisions made on this project, including the context, rationale and date. This will help maintain common understanding across the wider project team, and enable us to review past decisions when the context or the basis for a decision change.

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

## Decision

We will capture key Product Decisions and save them in an [accessible GitHub repository](https://github.com/Crown-Commercial-Service/CMp-Architecture-Decision-Records).
 We will not capture day-to-day decisions, but those material to the product direction, scope, or approach.

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
to store these decisions.

In particular, we recognise that decisions can be proposed and accepted, as well as deprecated or superseded, as we continue to iterate and learn.

The Product Manager(s) own the status and content of PDRs. 


## Consequences

Decisions must be written so as not to contain sensitive information.
